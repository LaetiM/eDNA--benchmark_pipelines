# benchmark_pipelines

Assessment of metabarcoding data pipelines :
The goal of this study is to compare the performance of sevveral bioinformatic tools to analyse fish eDNA data.
Seven steps of the analysis were identified, from the assemble of paired-end reads to the taxonomic assignation.
For each of these steps, different programs to compare were identified, as shown below :

For each step, all the programs are compared, while the start and the end of the pipeline are standardized with a reference pipeline ([Script_obitools_reference.sh](Script_obitools_reference.sh)). This pipeline is based on [OBItools](https://git.metabarcoding.org/obitools/obitools/wikis/home) a set of python programs designed to analyse Next Generation Sequencer outputs (illumina) in the context of DNA Metabarcoding.
