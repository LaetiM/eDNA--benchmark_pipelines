## Documentation

This documentation file can be
[found here](https://github.com/enormandeau/barque/blob/master/README.md) or
in the `README.md` file in the **Barque** repository.

## Description

**Barque** is an eDNA metabarcoding analysis pipeline that annotates reads,
instead of Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTUs), using high quality barcoding databases.
It can also produce OTUs, which are then annotated using a database and then these
OTUs are used as a database.

## Use cases

The approach implemented in **Barque** is especially useful for species
management projects:

- Monitoring of invasive species
- Confirming the presence of specific species
- Characterizing meta-communities in varied environments
- Improving species distribution knowledge for cryptic taxa
- Following loss of species over medium to long-term monitoring

Since Barque depends on the use of high quality barcoding databases, it is
especially useful for COI amplicons used in combination with the Barcode of
Life Database (BOLD) or 12S amplicons with the mitofish database, although it
can also use any database, like the Silva database for the 18s gene or a custom
database.

## Installation

To use **Barque**, you will need a local copy of its repository. Different releases can be
[accessed here](https://github.com/enormandeau/barque/releases).
It is recommended to use the latest version.

### Dependencies

You will also need to have the following programs installed on your computer.

- OSX or GNU Linux
- bash 4+
- python 3.5+
- [gnu parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) v1.2.11+
- [flash (read merger)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/flashpage/)
- [vsearch](https://github.com/torognes/vsearch)
  - /!\ **v2.14.2+ needed** /!\ 
  - **Barque will not work with older versions of vsearch**

### Preparation

- Install dependencies
- Download **Barque** (see **Installation** section above)
- Get database and format it (Python scripts)
  - Fasta format
  - Name line has 3 informations separated by an underscore (`_`)
  - Ex: `>Phylum_Genus_species`
  - Ex: `>Mammal_rattus_norvegicus`
- Edit `02_info/primers.csv` to provide needed informations for your primers
- Make a copy of `02_info/barque_config.sh` and edit the parameters for your run

## Analyses steps

During the analyses, the following steps are performed:

- Filter and trim raw reads (`trimmomatic`)
- Merge paired-end reads (`flash`)
- Split merged reads by amplicon (Python script)
- Look for chimeras (optional, `vsearch --vsearch_global`)
- Merge unique reads (Python script)
- Find species associated with each unique read (`vsearch`)
- Summarize results (Python script)
  - Tables of phylum, genus, and species counts per sample, including multiple hits
  - Chimera sequences
  - Cases of multiple hits with equal scores
  - Number of reads remaining at each analysis step
  - Most frequent non-annotated sequences to blast on NCBI nt/nr
  - Species counts for these non-annotated sequences

## Running the pipeline

NOTE: If you do not have a dataset, you can use the test dataset. See the **Test
dataset** section near the end of this file.

### Formatting database

The pre-formatted BOLD database can be
[downloaded here](http://www.bio.ulaval.ca/louisbernatchez/files/bold.fasta.gz).

If you do not already have the indexed database and want to use BOLD, you will
need to download all the animal BINs from
[this BOLD page](http://www.boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_BarcodeIndexNumber_Home).
Put the downloaded Fasta files in `03_databases/bold_bins` (you may need to
create that folder), and run the commands to format the bold database:

```bash
# Format each BIN individually (~10 minutes)
# Note: the `species_to_remove.txt` file is optional
ls -1 03_databases/bold_bins/*.fas.gz |
    parallel ./01_scripts/util/format_bold_database.py \
    {} {.}_prepared.fasta.gz species_to_remove.txt

# Concatenate the resulting formatted bins into one file (~10 seconds)
gunzip -c 03_databases/bold_bins/*_prepared.fasta.gz > 03_databases/bold.fasta
```

### Configuration file

Make a copy of the file named `02_info/barque_config.sh` and modify the
parameters as needed, then launch the `barque` executable with the name of your
configuration file as an argument, like this:

```bash
./barque 02_info/MY_CONFIG_FILE.sh
```

### Launching Barque

For each new project, get a new copy of **Barque** from the sources listed in
the **Installation** section and copy your data in the `04_data` folder.  You
will also need to put a database in Fasta format in the `03_databases` folder.

## Results

Once the pipeline has finished running, all result files are found in the
`12_results` folder.

After a run, it is recomended to make a copy of this folder and name it with the
current date, ex: `12_results_PROJECT_NAME_2019-10-08`

### Taxa count tables, named after the primer names

- `PRIMER_phylum_table.csv`
- `PRIMER_genus_table.csv`
- `PRIMER_species_table.csv`

### Chimeras

- `chimera_PRIMER.fasta.unique.chimeras`. No chimera detected if this file is empty.

### Information about sequences with multiple hits of equal score

- `PRIMER_species_table.csv`: This file contains sequences that were equally
similar to more than one database species are annotated specially. For these
sequences, the first two columns contain the text `zMultiple` and `Hits` and
the fourth one `MultipleHits`. The third column contains the name of all the
taxa that from which it was impossible to choose an annotation.

### Sequence dropout report

- `sequence_dropout.csv`: Listing how many sequences were present in each
sample for every analysis step. Depending on library and sequencing quality, as
well as the biological diversity found at the sample site, more or less
sequences are lost at each of the analysis steps.

### Most frequent non-annotated sequences

- `most_frequent_non_annotated_sequences.fasta`: Sequences that are frequent in
the samples but were not annotated by the pipeline. This Fasta file should be
used to query the NCBI nt/nr database (**you will need to change the default
value**) using the online portal [found
here](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch) to see
what species may have been missed. Use `blastn` with default parameters.  Once
the NCBI blastn search is finished, download the results as a text file and use
the following command (you will need to adjust the input and output file names)
to generate a report of the most frequently found species in the non-annotated
sequences:

### Summarize species found in non-annotated sequences

```bash
./01_scripts/10_report_species_for_non_annotated_sequences.py \
    12_results/NCBI-Alignment.txt \
    12_results/most_frequent_non_annotated_sequences_species_ncbi.csv
```

The result file will contain one line per identified taxon and the number of
sequences for each taxon, sorted in decreasing order. For any species of
interest found in this file, it is a good idea to download the representative
sequences from NCBI, add them to the database, and rerun the analysis.

## Lather, Rinse, Repeat

Once the pipeline has been run, it is normal to find that unexpected species
have been found or that a proportion of the reads have not been identified,
either because the sequenced species are absent from the database or because
the sequences have the exact same distance from two or more sequences in the
database. In these cases, you will need to create a list of unwanted species to
be later removed from the database or download additional sequences for the
non-annotated species from NCBI to add them to the database. Once the database
has been improved, simply run the last part of the pipeline by making sure you
have `SKIP_DATA_PREP=1` in your config file. You may need to repeat this step
again until you are not satisfied with the results.

NOTE: You should provide justifications in your publications if you decide to
remove some species from the database.

## Test dataset

A test dataset and corresponding `primers.csv` file is available as a
[sister repository on GitHub](https://github.com/enormandeau/barque_test_dataset).
Download the repository and then move the data in **Barque**'s `04_data` folder
and the `primers.csv` file in the `02_info` folder. Follow the normal pipeline
procedure (including database preparation) to analyse this small dataset. It
should run in one to ten minutes, depending on your computer.
